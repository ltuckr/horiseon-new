## Description: 

This is a reconfiguration of some of the HTML and CSS on this site's existing source code to allow for more accessibilty, and better search engine optimization. This is actually my second attempt. My first attempt was over-ambitious, and I ended up out in the weeds; but what I have learned is, the path of least resistence is a legit goal in coding, and there is definitely such a thing as over-thinking. 

## Installation

This is a simple web page URL. Deploying the link should allow you to arrive at the following screen: 


## Usage

Provide instructions and examples for use. Include screenshots as needed.

To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```
